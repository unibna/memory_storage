The Memory Storage website is the place user can store their memories.

How to store your memory:
- Log in with username/password or Facebook account.
- Click the "new memory" on the homepage.
- Describe your memory and pick the location on the map.
- View your all memories on the homepage.

**Note: If you do not log in, you have no permission to do anything.

To create this application, I used the following Python modules/library:
- django_social_auth: authenticate with social media like Facebook/Instagram.
- floppyforms: add the map to pick location on memory creation page.
- crispy-forms: format the input fields.
- folium: visualize the map on memory detail page.
